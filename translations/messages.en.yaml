# Recommendations spotify
acousticness_explanation: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. Very acoustic represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
acousticness_rangelow: A little acoustic
acousticness_rangehigh: Very acoustic
danceability_explanation: Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
danceability_rangelow: A little dancing
danceability_rangehigh: Very dancing
energy_explanation: Energy is a measure that represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
energy_rangelow: A little energic
energy_rangehigh: Very energic
instrumentalness_explanation: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is high, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above the average are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value is high.
instrumentalness_rangelow: Lots of singing
instrumentalness_rangehigh: A little singing
liveness_explanation: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.
liveness_rangelow: Studio
liveness_rangehigh: Live
speechiness_explanation: Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.
speechiness_rangelow: Very little
speechiness_rangehigh: A lot
valence_explanation: A measure describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
valence_rangelow: A little positive
valence_rangehigh: Very positive
popularity_explanation: "The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.
  Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time."
popularity_rangelow: Unpopular
popularity_rangehigh: Very popular
